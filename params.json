It's simply to gain more knowledge of the .NET framework and to increase development skills.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n - One of the fastest booting OSes I've seen - thanks to the C# Open Source Managed Operating System (Cosmos)\r\n - Built-in text editor and file browser (though filesystem stuff is disabled because Cosmos is working on fixing their FAT driver)\r\n\r\n#### Future features\r\n\r\nThese are some plans for the future:\r\n\r\n - ShiftOS compatibility\r\n - Roslyn C# compiler built directly into the kernel.",
