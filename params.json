It's simply to gain more knowledge of the .NET framework and to increase development skills.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n - One of the fastest booting OSes I've seen - thanks to the C# Open Source Managed Operating System (Cosmos)\r\n - Working file browser!\r\n - Easy as heck to install. Seriously. Grandma could do it.\r\n\r\n#### Future features\r\n\r\nThese are some plans for the future:\r\n\r\n - ShiftOS compatibility\r\n - Roslyn C# compiler built directly into the kernel.\r\n - Multiple languages (Polish is planned.)\r\n - Appscape Package Manager\r\n - Full Windows Forms port",
